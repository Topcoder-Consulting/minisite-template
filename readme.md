Not a lot of you know this, but my good friends call me "The Postman". Why you ask? **Because I deliver!** [I told you last week](http://www.topcoder.com/blog/hp-idol-ondemand-250-api-key-sweepstakes/) to sign up API Keys for [HP IDOL OnDemand](http://idolondemand.topcoder.com/) because we would be running 20+ challenges using these cool new APIs.

I hate to keep beating this dead horse, but I delivered on my promise. If you check out the [HP IDOL OnDemand community](http://idolondemand.topcoder.com/) you'll see 9 challenges currently running. So hop on the API-train and get to codin'! If you don't have an HP IDOL OnDemand API Key, it's [free and easy to get one](http://idolondemand.topcoder.com/#registration). 

### [Cloud Mashup](http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30042647/?type=development#.U3Oiuq1dU8M)
Do you have a great idea for some type of cloud mashup with IDOL OnDemand and let's say, Docusign or Twilio or Facebook? This is you chance!  The deliverable for this challenge is a working application that calls the API’s of two different platform. Of course, you can call as many different API’s as you want but at least one of them should be the IDOL OnDemand API’s. How about an app that extracts text from a PDF and sends it via SMS with Twilio? How about scanning your friends' pictures using facial detection and then posting them to their Facebook wall? Sooo many great ideas!!
